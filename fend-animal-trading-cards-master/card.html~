			<p class="p1"> They live in colonies called "herds" at high elevations up to 4,270 m (14,000 ft). Today colonies in the wild are known only in Chile.

The chinchilla has the second-densest fur of any land mammal. Most chinchillas currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessories are farm-raised.</p>

			<p class="p2">Chinchillas have a very thick coat of fur (as many as 60 hairs per follicle) that was originally a blue-gray in color; however, today chinchillas have been bred with coats that are black, gray, white, beige, and combinations of each. Their thick fur not only keeps them warm, it also protects them from fleas, lice, and predators. Chinchillas have a rounded body, large mouse-like ears, short legs, and a long tail. A healthy baby weighs 2 to 2.5 ounces (60 to 70 grams) at birth. A mature chinchillaâ€™s weight ranges from 1 to 1.5 pounds (450 to 680 grams). Females are usually larger than males. They can grow to be 10 inches (25 centimeters) long, with a tail that can add another 6 inches (15 centimeters) when they fully mature. They have an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years, although some have lived as long as 20 years in captivity.</p>
